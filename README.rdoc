== Welcome to my StudentBodyRailsApp
I transformed my studentbody repository from a sinatra app, to a super duper rails app.  The only thing this app doesn't contain is the scraper from [studentbody](https://github.com/styliii/studentbody).  I simply copied the database, changed the config file, and everything worked seamlessly.
